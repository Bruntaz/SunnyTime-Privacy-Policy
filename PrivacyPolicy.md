# SunnyTime Privacy Policy

I do not collect any data on the users of SunnyTime. All of SunnyTimeâ€™s data is stored locally on the device and therefore does not require any internet access (other than for the links to the wiki, which I have no ability to track).

I do not own, and have no control over the wiki entry for each episode linked from the app. The wiki (currently powered by FANDOM) has its own independent privacy policy, and I have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.


## Changes to this policy

If I decide to change the privacy policy for SunnyTime, the policy will be updated here. Summary of the changes so far:

* 30 September 2018: Initial creation
